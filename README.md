How crypto Work Crypto is not designed to be a standalone economy on your server, but rather it works in conjunction with your existing economy plugin as players can exchange crypto for your normal currency. See more about the value of Crypto below.

Value of Crypto Just like in real-life, the value of Crypto is volatile and unstable. Every (Minecraft) day at 6:00 am (by default), the value of Crypto will fluctuate. By holding on to Crypto, players take the risk of the value decreasing, but the risk could pay off if the value increases. Also, there is now an option to use the real value of Crypto. Simply enable the setting in the config.

How do I get Crypto? Mining of course! You won't need a pickaxe for Crypto mining though... Crypto mining in Minecraft isn't as difficult as real-life crypto mining but it isn't easy either! You must be the first player to solve a 4x4 sliding tile puzzle in order to receive the crypto reward. If you feel this is too easy, set the puzzle_difficulty in the config to 'hard'
